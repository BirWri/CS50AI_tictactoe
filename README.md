This project is to finish the build of a simple tic tac toe game. The assignment is to complete the implementations of player, actions, result, winner, terminal, utility, and minimax functions.
Once all functions are implemented correctly, a game can be ran and a user can play against your AI. And, since Tic-Tac-Toe is a tie given optimal play by both sides, you should never be able to beat the AI.
